## Resume Generation with Artist-made Templates
<i>Where Art meets Professionals</i>

## Why does this exist?
Applying to jobs has changed drastically from speaking to your uncle's friend's son for a job to scouring hundreds of job sites and applying to every posting that looks remotely close to your qualifications.

Now, hiring managers spend hundreds of hours flipping through resumes, making yes, no and maybe piles and deciding what to put where in a few seconds. It is high time that the traditional resume you have been giving out for years gets revamped. Better yet, it should be tailored to that job you can't stop thinking about.

ResuME is a crowd-sourced resume templating website which does the work of formatting for you. Link your social media and LinkedIn accounts to pull job history and projects and add your own credentials and qualifications. From there, upload the job application (or select what to include) and pick a template to generate a DOCX file to change and tweak to your desire.

## What is P0?
Allowing users to submit handmade templates for making beautiful and informative resumes, or use them by uploading their work and life experience.

## What is P1?
Make the de-facto location for storing all the information one has accomplished, experienced or delivered in their lifetime

## How would this work?
Uploading information and using templates will be completely free, and the artist would get a kick-back everytime their resume is used from advertisements on the website. Some features would be premium, like avoiding advertisements, access to top-tier templates and unlimited storage space on our site.
